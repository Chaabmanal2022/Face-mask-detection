# Face Mask Detection using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

## 📚 Introduction
This project focuses on **Face Mask Detection** using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**. The model is designed to classify whether a person is wearing a mask or not, aiming to promote safety and adherence to public health guidelines, particularly during pandemics like COVID-19.

## 🧠 Project Overview
The system leverages the power of **Deep Learning** to identify and distinguish between two classes:
- **With Mask**
- **Without Mask**

This is achieved through a **CNN model** that processes image data and makes predictions based on facial features.

## 🚀 Features
- **Real-time Detection**: Identify mask usage in real-time via webcam or video input.
- **High Accuracy**: The model is trained on a large dataset to ensure precise detection.
- **User-Friendly**: Easy to deploy and use for personal or organizational purposes.

## 📁 Dataset
The dataset used for this project can be downloaded from Kaggle:  
[Face Mask Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/omkargurav/face-mask-dataset)  

It contains images of faces with and without masks, covering:
- **Various lighting conditions and angles.**
- **Diverse demographics, including age, gender, and ethnicity.**

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Deep Learning Framework**: TensorFlow/Keras
- **Libraries**: OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib
- **Model Architecture**: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

## ⚙️ Workflow
1. **Data Collection**: Images of faces with and without masks.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Resizing, normalization, and augmentation.
3. **Model Training**: Using CNN to learn facial features.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Testing on unseen data to measure accuracy.
5. **Deployment**: Integration with webcam or video streams for real-time detection.
